You've been writing the version you wished were true, but you know it's not nearly good enough. If this paper collapses, your psych class collapses, and academic probation isn't a threat. It's next semester.

    Sister Agnes reads the final paragraph on the laptop, nodding once. The agenda notes, the cemetery goals, and the honest reflection sit inside the draft like ribs, holding it up.
    SISTER AGNES: "This is the self-improvement essay I was promised. You faced the work, and you proved how you'll keep facing it."

        She taps the revised line Malik just helped you fix — a quiet nod for taking the help when it mattered.

    She sets a tarnished pocket watch in your palm. The hands spin once and settle on last Monday's sunrise.
    SISTER AGNES: "Take the week back. Remember what you wrote here. Live it."

    You finish before the DEADline. The agenda and goal tracker prove you did the work tonight, but the essay still dodges the raw edges.
    Agnes reads the last paragraph on the screen and leans back.
    SISTER AGNES: "You met the deadline, but you're still telling yourself half-truths. Without honesty, a plan is just ink."
    The pocket watch stays on her side of the desk. She slides the laptop back toward you.
